# Prawnalith Heads-Up Display

It's a small view of statuses for all the tanks.

## Mock server

There's a mock server available in the [mock_server](mock_server) directory.

```
node app.js
```

You should run this if you want to have a simple response payload to test against.
It will provide tank id, name, temp reading, pH val, etc.

# Prawnalith Mini Frontend 

See https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web, this is inspired by the Demo directory, but doesn't contain the full Firebase UI install.  If you want to run it locally, you'd need to clone the firebaseui-web repo and build per the instructions.

## Deployment

```
firebase deploy
```
